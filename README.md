# 🛒 Supermarket Sales Data Analysis

**🎯 Task 1 – Internship Project at Brain Wave Matrix Solution**

An end-to-end **data preprocessing** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of a commercial supermarket dataset using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook**.

---

## 📌 Objective

To perform an in-depth **sales analysis** of a supermarket business using a structured approach that includes:
- Data cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Descriptive statistics
- Visual exploration

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Name:** Supermarket Sales Dataset  
- **Source:** Public (CSV format)  
- **Features:** `Invoice ID`, `Branch`, `City`, `Customer Type`, `Gender`, `Product Line`, `Total`, `Date`, `Time`, `Payment`, etc.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib  
- WordCloud

## 📈 Analysis Covered

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Converted `Date` and `Time` columns to datetime format
- Extracted `day`, `month`, `year`, and `hour` for time-based analysis
- Handled missing or malformed data

### 2. **Descriptive Analysis**
- Correlation matrix
- Relationship between `Tax`, `Total`, `Gross Income`, and `Cogs`
- Calculated and visualized average customer rating

### 3. **Custom Visual Functions**
- Created reusable functions for:
  - `countplot`
  - `boxplot`
  - `lineplot`
  - `relplot`

### 4. **Key Business Questions Answered**
- Which **city** or **branch** generates the most revenue?
- What **time of day** sees the most sales?
- What are the **customer preferences** by product line and branch?
- Does **customer type** affect rating and sales?
- What are the preferred **payment methods**?
- What are the most **popular product categories**? *(via WordCloud)*

## 📌 Visual Insights

- 📉 Sales trends by **hour**, **month**, and **branch**
- 📦 Product line distribution across branches
- 💳 Customer payment preferences
- 🛍️ Product popularity using **WordCloud**
